        What & Why

      %p This page is an introduction to what Mint is.

      %h2
        What Is Mint?

      %p
        Mint is a language specifically created for writing

        = succeed "." do
          %b single-page applications

        It is a compiler and a framework combined to provide great
        developer experience while allowing to write safe, readable
        and maintainable code.

      %p
        It was born out of the frustration of the JavaScript language and
        ecosystem (NPM) and the Elm language and its not-so-open
        development practices.

      %h3
        What is wrong with JavaScript?

      %p
        JavaScript is not a strongly typed language which makes it difficult to
        write error-free code and leads to not-so-great developer experience.
        Also, it does not have the tools to create web applications out of the box;
        you need frameworks and compilers and build tools that increase complexity.

      %h3
        What is wrong with Elm?

      %p
        Elm has great developer experience, but it being a purely functional
        language leads to some boilerplate code and makes it harder to learn.
        Also, it's not possible to contribute or influence the language in any
        meaningful way.

      %h2
        Why Mint?

      %p
        Mint aims to combine the developer experience of Elm and the
        expressiveness of React to create the perfect language for
        building single-page applications.

      %p
